3.1 How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).

In an hour there are 60 minutes and in a minute there are 60 seconds.
Therefore, the number of seconds in an hour = 1*60*60
Number of seconds in an hour = 3600 seconds.

3.2 Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour.

seconds_per_hour = 3600

3.3 How many seconds are in a day? Use your seconds_per_hour variable.

Number of hours in a day = 24 hours.
Number of seconds in an hour = 3600 = seconds_per_hour
The number of seconds in a day = 24* seconds_per_hour.

Therefore, the number of seconds in a day = 24* seconds_per_hour. (24*3600)



3.4 Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day.
Number of hours in a day = 24 hours.
Number of seconds in an hour = 3600 = seconds_per_hour
The number of seconds in a day = 24* seconds_per_hour.
seconds_per_hour = 3600
seconds_per_day = 24 * seconds_per_hour

3.5 Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.

The required division =seconds_per_day/seconds_per_hour

3.6 Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?

The required division =seconds_per_day//seconds_per_hour.

Yes, the number agrees with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0 The '/' returns the floating point variable and the '//' returns the integer value with .0 at last.
